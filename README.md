# Problem

A newspaper editor was researching immigration data trends on H1B(H-1B, H-1B1, E-3) visa application processing over the past years, trying to identify the occupations and states with the most number of approved H1B visas. She has found statistics available from the US Department of Labor and its [Office of Foreign Labor Certification Performance Data](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm#dis). But while there are ready-made reports for [2018](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/PerformanceData/2018/H-1B_Selected_Statistics_FY2018_Q4.pdf) and [2017](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/PerformanceData/2017/H-1B_Selected_Statistics_FY2017.pdf), the site doesnâ€™t have them for past years. 

The purpose of this repo is to create a mechanism to analyze past years data, specificially calculate two metrics: **Top 10 Occupations** and **Top 10 States** for **certified** visa applications.


# Input Dataset

Raw data could be found [here](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm) under the __Disclosure Data__ tab (i.e., files listed in the __Disclosure File__ column with ".xlsx" extension). 
File name h1b_input.csv is converted into semicolon separated (";") format.


# Output

This program will create 2 output files in the output folder:
* `top_10_occupations.txt`: Top 10 occupations for certified visa applications
* `top_10_states.txt`: Top 10 states for certified visa applications
Each line holds one record and each field on each line is separated by a semicolon (;).
The records in the files are sorted by __`NUMBER_CERTIFIED_APPLICATIONS`__, and in case of a tie, alphabetically by __`TOP_OCCUPATIONS`__ or __`TOP_STATES`__.

sample output:

then your output files would be:

`./output/top_10_occupations.txt`:
```
TOP_OCCUPATIONS;NUMBER_CERTIFIED_APPLICATIONS;PERCENTAGE
SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS, APPLICATIONS;6;60.0%
ACCOUNTANTS AND AUDITORS;1;10.0%
COMPUTER OCCUPATIONS, ALL OTHER;1;10.0% 
COMPUTER SYSTEMS ANALYST;1;10.0%
DATABASE ADMINISTRATORS;1;10.0%
```
`./output/top_10_states.txt`:
```
TOP_STATES;NUMBER_CERTIFIED_APPLICATIONS;PERCENTAGE
FL;2;20.0%
AL;1;10.0%
CA;1;10.0%
DE;1;10.0%
GA;1;10.0%
MD;1;10.0%
NJ;1;10.0%
TX;1;10.0%
WA;1;10.0%
``` 

# Instructions


Simply execute ./run.sh in the main repo then the output files will be generated. The python script only recognize input file name h1b_input.csv and the output file names are fixed. Need to make adjustment to h1b_counting.py in src in order to support file with different names or different output.
